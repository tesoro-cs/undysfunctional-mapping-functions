* These functions assume that you already have code set up for importing and exporting your map, so just put these functions wherever you feel like
* Comments and other `@params` have been put in to make things easier to use
* This repository is not meant for just my functions, so if you want to submit your own, DM me at `TheGoodBoi#3330` or submit a pull request
* If you want more functions in the meantime, you can look at some other templates:
    * [Mawntee's](https://github.com/Mawntee/Noodle-Extensions-Template-FIle) (JavaScript)
    * [megamaz's](https://github.com/megamaz/python-noodleExtensions-template) (Python)

## What is This?

[Beat Saber](https://beatsaber.com) is a VR rhythm game about cutting blocks with sabers in time with music. A mod exists called [Noodle Extensions](https://noodleextensions.com) which allows complete control over the movement, size, and [other properties](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki/AnimationProperties) of these blocks, along with other in-game objects. This respiratory is meant to make coding for these movements easier, mostly by lowering the amount of repetition. I made this repo a bit separate from [the real one](https://github.com/TheGoodBoi411/undysfunctional-mapping-functions), because I plan on making mine fully public.
